# 01

Model is an abstract representation of the reality.

The purpose of the model is to anticipate the existence of any reality so it's possible to evaluate the structure and behavior of the reality before it exists.

## Fields

- External: The model of the ambient where the system will be.
- Behavioral: The model of the system's dynamic behavior.
- Structural: The model of the system's organizational structure and the data the system processes.
- Interaction: The model of the system's interaction with it's componenets and the external environment.

## Process of Development of a System

There's a hiatus between a nebulous idea and a concrete system. This hiatus is called "semantic gap".

### Organizing the Process to Develop a System

- Identifying the Requirements: The system's requirements are defined.
- Analysis: With the requirements, it's understandable what the system should do.
- Project: The system is designed. Defining the architecture, the components, the infrastructure, etc.
- Implementation: Coding the system (yahu).

# 02

That was just O.O.P.

## System Development Layers

- Presentation: Allows interaction with the system.
- Business: The system's business logic.
- Data: Responsible for storing and retrieving persistent system data.

# 03

## UML

UML stands for Unified Modeling Language.

Basically diagrams everywhere. That's it, great notes.
