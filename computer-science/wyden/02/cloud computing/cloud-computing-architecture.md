## Aspects of IT Infrastructure

### On-premise x in the cloud\*\*

- On-premise: the infrastructure is managed by the company itself.
- In the cloud: the infrastructure is managed by a third party.

### Cloud Infrastructure

- **Server Layer**
  - Physical Servers
  - Virtual Servers
  - Hybrid Servers
- **Storage Layer**
  - File Storage
  - Database
  - And other types of storage
- **Network Layer**
  - Connectivity Services
  - Network Security
  - Applications Management

## Management of Servers Layers

The main cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) offers platforms to manage the servers layer, like (EC2, VMs, Compute Engine).

## Architecture by Solution

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**:
  - Virtual Servers
  - Servers Instances
  - Storage Systems
  - Data Management Systems
  - Load Balancing Tools
  - Deal with multiple scenarios (e.g. elasticity scenario, load balancing scenario, high availability scenario, multicloud scenario, hybrid cloud scenario, etc.)

## Edge Computing

It allows to process data closer to the source, reducing latency and bandwidth usage.
