## Aspects of IT Infrastructure

### On-premise x in the cloud**

- On-premise: the infrastructure is managed by the company itself.
- In the cloud: the infrastructure is managed by a third party.

### Cloud Infrastructure

- **Server Layer**
    - Physical Servers
    - Virtual Servers
    - Hybrid Servers
- **Storage Layer**
    - File Storage
    - Database
    - And other types of storage
- **Network Layer**
    - Connectivity Services
    - Network Security
    - Applications Management

## Management of Servers Layers

The main cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) offers platforms to manage the servers layer, like (EC2, VMs, Compute Engine).

## Architecture by Solution

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**:
    - Virtual Servers
    - Servers Instances
    - Storage Systems
    - Data Management Systems
    - Load Balancing Tools
    - Deal with multiple scenarios (e.g. elasticity scenario, load balancing scenario, high availability scenario, multicloud scenario, hybrid cloud scenario, etc.)

## Edge Computing

It allows to process data closer to the source, reducing latency and bandwidth usage.
