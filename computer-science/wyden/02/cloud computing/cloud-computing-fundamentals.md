## Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. _Ty Wikipedia._

### In short:

- Cloud users can store files, data and applications on remote servers and access this data with the help of the internet.
- Therefore, users do not need to be in a certain location to access data and can retrieve it from anywhere.

### Utility computing

We can also say that cloud computing is the evolution of on-demand information technology services and products, called utility computing. This type of service aims to provide the basic components such as storage, processing and bandwidth of a network through specialized providers at a low cost.

### Advantages

- **Cost reduction**: Paying for the use of a service is much cheaper than buying and maintaining equipment and software, most of the time.
- **Scalability**: It's possible to increase the use of resources as needed, compatible with horizontal and vertical scaling.
- **Elasticity**: It's possible to adapt the disposal of resources according to the demand of the moment.
- **Constant updates**: The cloud provider is responsible for updating the infrastructure, which is done automatically.
- **Fast Implantation**: The services requested are available in a no time.
- **Global Access**: The services are available anywhere in the world, at any time, as long as there is an internet connection.
- **Availability**: The provider offers backup services and disaster recovery, which guarantees the availability of the services.
- **Security**: The provider is responsible for the security of the infrastructure.

### Disadvantages

- **No Control**: The user has no control over the infrastructure, which can be a problem in some cases.
- **Interruption**: If the provider suffers an interruption (energy, conectivity or even a cyber attack), the user will not be able to access the services.
- **Security**: Attacks might happen to the provider, which is a risk to the user. Other than that, you can suffer from attacks to other clients of the provider.

### Main Cloud Providers

- AWS (The best one so far)
- MS Azure
- Google Cloud
- IBM Cloud
- Oracle Cloud

### Virtualization

Having various servers to do the job is complicated, because it's expensive and usually the server would not operate in full capacity.

With **virtualization**, it's possible to have multiple operational system in one server, simulating multiple servers. The physical server hosts several virtual servers, configured according to the company's service demand, with independent operating systems and resources (memory, processor, storage, etc.).

> That's what the **hypervisor** does.

## Models of Cloud Computing

### IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service

The provider offers the infrastructure, such as servers, storage, network, etc, with virtualization. The user is responsible for the operating system, middleware, applications, data and security.

### PaaS - Platform as a Service

The provider offers the infrastructure, the operating system and all the tools needed to develop and run applications, with virtualization.

### SaaS - Software as a Service

This model allows users to connect and use cloud-based applications over the Internet, such as email, storage services, etc. In this model the user just use the applications.

### Private Cloud and Public Cloud

Basically private cloud is dedicated to a single or multiple selected clients, while public cloud is available to the general public.

### Hybrid Cloud, Community Cloud and Distributed Cloud

- **Hybrid Cloud**: It's a combination of two or more cloud infrastructures, such as private and public cloud, for example.
- **Community Cloud**: It's a cloud infrastructure shared by several organizations that have common interests, such as security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.
- **Distributed Cloud**: It's a public cloud infrastructure that is physically located in different geographic locations, but the operation is centralized.

## Infrastructure on Premise x on Cloud

- **On Premise**: The infrastructure is located in the company's own data center.
- **On Cloud**: The infrastructure is located in the provider's data center.
